# scrolling-countdown
This is a scrolling countdown. I'm not saying that this is new but I didn't found something like this. So this is a CSS countdown controlled by javascript and you can set the date in the .txt file.

``On some servers the text file is not working for the date so you can make it a .js file or define it in html or what you want.``

The original countdown I found just had a minute and second counter and was controlled by the animation time.  
I expanded this countdown to days:hours:minutes:seconds.

Hope you enjoy this little project.
